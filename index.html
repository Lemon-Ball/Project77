        <h2>Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.</h2>
        <h2>A console traditionally refers to a computer terminal where a user may input commands and view output such as the results of inputted commands or status messages from the computer. The console is often connected to a remote computer or computer system that is controlled from the console.</h2>
